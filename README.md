Does the new FPL website make you want to take a -32 point hit and never play the game again?

FPL Time Machine gives you the ability to go back to a better time with these features:

## Features

âš½ Centered content area  
âš½ Sidebar on the left  
âš½ Hidden global navigation  
âš½ Hidden ads  
âš½ An easy to use configurator pop-up where you can enable/disable any feature  
âš½ A cool loading screen with fun messages while you wait for the layout to fix itself

## Limitations

ðŸ›‘ Only modifies on the `/my-team` and `/transfers` pages  
ðŸ›‘ This is an early version so there may be bugs  
ðŸ›‘ Not tested with dark mode

## Technical Details

The extension reliably identifies page elements based on the page structure without relying on CSS classes, and adds it's own CSS classes to make styling easier:
- `fpl-main-nav` - Main navigation container
- `fpl-ad-container` - Advertisement sections
- `fpl-content-wrapper` - Main content wrapper
- `fpl-main-area` - Primary content area
- `fpl-side-bar` - Sidebar elements
